# LighTide

Get sunset/sunrise details + tide details based on the selected position on the map.

## Description

My goal is to create an app which would be useful to researchers/scientists/hobbyists/trekkers/anyone who need information regarding sunlight/tides. Upon selecting a location on the map, the coordinates (lat/long) are parsed into the sunlight&tides API and users can see the results on screen.

Knowing the tides are essential to the safety of people going to the sea/ocean/etc, and having the knowledge of sunrise/sunset can help in planning for the activity.
