## Project Post Mortem


#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
Might probably try out different libraries like MUI and see how it works.
Started project early so when I learnt of MUI my project was alraedy underway and it wasn't convenient to change.

2. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
Starting early and breaking things up into different components for easier coding and reference.

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
Probably can make things even more modular and split into more components, like the "Date" example Simon commented.

2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
I think what went well was having all the different libraries work together to create a functioning app.
I would continue reading the documentation and exploring examples online to better understand how to use the library.

For each, please include code examples.

1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### SEI Post Mortem

1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Learning about new libraries and checking whether they are suitable for the project.

2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Probably could utilise more tools that we covered in class - I didn't use some react tools like useParams.

3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
Course materials were alright, if there were any parts I didn't understand I can just google.
